## Full Narration

### OPENING (Lines 10-20) — 15 seconds

> "Ed, this is a quick walkthrough of the unified organization system we've designed. The goal is simple: surface what needs your attention, hide everything else, and make sure nothing falls through the cracks."

---

### THE THREE ENGINES (Lines 88-120) — 30 seconds

> "The system has three engines. The Professional Engine handles your intellectual work—Neo4j, Zingers, the OpEd pipeline. The Content Marketing Engine manages your public presence—website, social, book promotion. And the Personal Engine covers everything else—travel, health, household, finance. Each engine runs independently but feeds into a single daily view."

---

### ROLE-BASED VIEWS (Lines 122-128) — 10 seconds

> "You'll interact through role-based dashboards. Your view shows only what requires your decision. Niki sees coordination tasks. Steve and Anthony see their domains. No one sees everything—just what's relevant to them."

---

### PROFESSIONAL SYSTEM (Lines 164-250) — 25 seconds

> "On the professional side, we're building on what already works. Neo4j holds your 6,000+ entries. Zingers get captured and tagged. The OpEd pipeline tracks ideas from draft to publication. The new layer adds better search, related-entry suggestions, and a cleaner topic hierarchy."

---

### PERSONAL SYSTEM (Lines 333-410) — 25 seconds

> "The personal system follows a key principle: categories don't compete. Fine dining doesn't substitute for neighborhood comfort food. Travel doesn't substitute for local entertainment. So instead of one ranked list, you get curated options within each category—ready when you need them, invisible when you don't."

---

### DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Lines 454-495) — 20 seconds

> "Three principles run through everything. First, exception-based surfacing—you only see what's off-track. Second, Shannon efficiency—high signal, minimal redundancy. Third, progressive disclosure—summary first, details on demand."

---

### IMPLEMENTATION STATUS (Lines 533-603) — 20 seconds

> "Where are we now? The professional system is partially built—Neo4j is live, Zingers work, topic tags exist but need refinement. The personal system is designed but not yet implemented. The content engine needs the most work."

---

### CLOSE + ASANA (Lines 606-645) — 20 seconds

> "The next steps are in the document—suggested skills to build, refinements to add. And we've already translated these priorities into action steps in Asana. The new EWC Database project tracks five workstreams: topic taxonomy, classification logic, Neo4j migration, site usability, and special topics extraction. You can see the full task breakdown there."

## Recording Tips

1. **Open the PRD document** in a text editor or VS Code
2. **Start screen recording** with Loom
3. **Scroll to each line range** as you read the corresponding narration
4. **Pause briefly** between sections to let Ed see the content
5. **Keep it conversational** — this is a walkthrough, not a presentation
