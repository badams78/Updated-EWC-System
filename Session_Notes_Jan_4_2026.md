### Personal System Deep Dive

- Added **Part 11: Source Discovery & Data Ingestion** — the "missing piece"
  - Source evaluation rubric
  - Pre-sprint discovery protocol (3 hours)

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Airtable for restaurant database | Relational, filtered views, API access, mobile-friendly; right complexity for ~200 items |
| 2-week sprint scope | Delivers value Day 2; builds sustainable infrastructure |
| Source pipeline as priority | "System is only as good as what flows into it" — data ingestion is the leverage point |
| Non-substitution principle as architectural foundation | Categories don't substitute; never rank across |

---

## Timeline Estimates

| Phase | Duration | What Gets Built |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | Database, core skills, output cadence, quick wins |
| Phase 2 | 2-3 weeks | Additional skills, refinements |
| Phase 3 | 4-6 weeks | Availability automation, alerts |
| Phase 4 | Ongoing | Preference learning, calendar integration |
| **Total to full vision** | 10-14 weeks | But value delivered from Day 2 |

---

## Open Items / Next Steps

1. **Before starting sprint:** 2-3 hours of source discovery (newsletters, Substacks)
2. **Day 1 of sprint:** Set up Airtable, begin data entry
3. **Day 2:** Deliver January recommendations to Ed (P0)
4. **Day 4:** Deliver 2AM Principal ideas to Ed (P0)
5. **v2 update made:** Niki Stellings-Hertzberg now listed as Chief of Staff
