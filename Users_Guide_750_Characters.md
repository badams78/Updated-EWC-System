# EWC Personal Organization System
## Summary

A unified platform to optimize Ed's time, maximize impact, and support legacy-building. The core proposition: time and attention are the scarcest resources—not money.

**Three Engines:**
1. **Professional** — Neo4j database powers Macro Roundup → Zingers extraction → OpEd production pipeline. AI drafts in Ed's voice; Ed refines.
2. **Content Marketing** — HubSpot analytics, subscriber segmentation, growth strategy for the 4,000-subscriber base.
3. **Personal** — Category-based restaurant/experience system respecting the non-substitution principle. Discovery engine for dining, books, events.

**Integration Layer** connects all three via unified calendar, time protection, and decision queue—surfacing only what requires Ed's attention.

**Design Philosophy:** Proactive, not reactive. Exception-based. Protect high-leverage activities (content production); minimize low-leverage friction (supervision, logistics, discovery).
