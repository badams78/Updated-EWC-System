2. Practical logistics (addresses, hours, pricing)
3. Booking/reservation guidance
4. "Recommendations for Mom Visit" section
5. Source citations at bottom
6. "Last updated" timestamp

### Key Dates to Remember
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|

## Implications for Personal Organization System

### What Worked Well
1. **Category-based folder structure** - Clean separation of concerns
2. **Consistent formatting** - Each file follows same template
3. **"Mom Recommendations" sections** - Tailored suggestions for travel companion
4. **Practical details** - Addresses, hours, pricing, booking tips all included
5. **Source documentation** - Verifiable research, trackable updates
6. **Cross-references** - Restaurant Week mentioned in both Restaurants and Events files

### Potential Improvements for Future System
1. **Date-based planning view** - Currently organized by category, not by day/itinerary
2. **Reservation tracking** - No central place to track what's been booked
3. **Budget tracking** - No running estimate of total trip cost
4. **Integration between categories** - e.g., "see show X, then eat at nearby restaurant Y"
5. **Weather contingency planning** - Indoor backup plans mentioned but not structured
6. **Travel logistics** - No flight, hotel, or transportation info

### Data Model Observations
Each venue/event could be represented as:
```
{
  name: string,
  category: enum (theater, restaurant, museum, comedy, sports, event),
  address: string,
  neighborhood: string,
  hours: object,
  pricing: { min: number, max: number, notes: string },
  booking: { required: boolean, advance_days: number, platform: string },
  dates: { start: date, end: date } | null,  // for limited-time events
  tags: string[],
  mom_suitable: boolean,
  notes: string,
  sources: string[]
}
```

## Summary

This project represents a thorough research effort for a January 2026 NYC trip, with particular attention to:
- **Timing optimization** (Winter Outing deals, exhibit end dates)
- **Guest-appropriate recommendations** (Mom-friendly options throughout)
- **Practical logistics** (addresses, hours, booking requirements)
- **Budget awareness** (free options, price tiers documented)
- **Source verification** (all claims cite authoritative sources)

The structure is clean and functional but could benefit from more cross-category integration and a day-by-day itinerary layer on top of the categorical research.
